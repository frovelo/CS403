;;  About:
;;		 Define a synchronization barrier object using using Scamâ€™s binary semaphore. Name this function barrier. You can use
;;		 the gettid function to access the ID of the thread asking for the semaphore.
;;
;;		 (define b (barrier 3)) ; make a barrier for three threads
;;		 ...
;;		 ((b'start))
;;		 ...
;;		 ((b'finish))
;;		 For this example, once three threads reach the starting point, the barrier is opened and the three threads (and only
;;		 those three threads) can pass. When those three threads reach the finish line, three more threads can pass (and so on).


;;  Previous Comments:
;;			barrier is too similar to another student's implementation, the test FAILED
;;   			 - please see me to explain
;;
;;			barrier appears to be correct
